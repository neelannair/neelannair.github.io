<p><strong><em>by Ian Kershaw</em></strong></p>
<p>In an attempt to better understand Hitler’s character and maybe pick up some interesting new stories, I started reading another tome, Hitler - Nemesis (1936-45) by Ian Kershaw.</p>
<p><img src="/images/hitler-nemesis.png" alt="Hitler Nemesis Book Cover"></p>
<p>This is a very dense book, with long chapters and a lot of citations. Its not light reading and took me a year or so of reading it off and on to complete.</p>
<p>One aspect is Kershaw’s theory that a great majority of the German people were indeed in support for a majority of Hitler’s plans. Like all things in history, this is not something I can agree with wholeheartedly because it is a theory and there are those that don’t think it to be the case. The concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Kershaw#%22Working_Towards_the_F%C3%BChrer%22_concept">‘working towards the führer’</a>where, though there was no direct command from Hitler for most of the atrocities of the war, the machinery of the government filled out the blanks left by Hitler’s vague comments.</p>
<p>Another was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blomberg%E2%80%93Fritsch_affair">Blomberg-Fritsch affair</a>. Its the story of how Hitler wrestled control of the military establishment. Blomberg, the War Minister, married a convicted prostitute - when prostitution was illegal in Germany at the time. And Frisch (the Commander in Chief) was accused of having a homosexual affair - which was later proved to be drummed up with a false witness. With both of these senior military figures unemployable in the highest military positions, both of whom were against war preparation, Hitler conveniently assumed control.</p>
<p>History lessons in school, especially Indian schools, don’t cover the nitty gritty and there is limited inquisitiveness encouraged when the priority is placed on scoring a grade in the final exam. There is no time to review the small interesting points of history which were turning points. Like <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KWQcos95hHsC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=neville+chamberlain+%22relied%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BGcbNWj2wS&amp;sig=0lT6zHMIf1WODz_2waNg0XXZ8m8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKo4PN8afMAhUI7hoKHUNSD04Q6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=neville%20chamberlain%20%22relied%22&amp;f=false">Neville Chamberlain’s statement</a> after meeting with Hitler in Munich 1938 that ‘[he] got the impression that here was a man [Hitler] who could be relied upon when he had given his word’.</p>
<p>I am not a historian and this was my first in depth reading of the Third Reich. With that in mind I felt this gave me a more rounded view into what happened. A more seasoned reviewer  - or at least someone I think is more seasoned because he writes for the Guardian - was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/07/historybooks.biography">not overly impressed with the book</a>, due particularly to the dependance on Hitler’s own conversations. Somehow, he expects Kershaw to have a lens into Hitler’s mind. I don’t think thats possible.</p>
