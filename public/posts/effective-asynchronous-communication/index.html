<p>I’ve spent the last 15 years working with teams and direct reports spread across geographies and time zones. One of the hardest lessons: communication is difficult. While working in the US, every back-and-forth with a colleague in APAC, for example, can cost an entire day. Over time, I’ve developed habits that make asynchronous communication more effective—and, for me, these have become the default way to communicate.</p>
<p>Here are some principles I’ve learned:</p>
<h3 id="1-be-extra-clear-and-complete">1. Be Extra Clear and Complete</h3>
<p>When your teammates aren’t online at the same time, clarity is everything. The goal is to leave as little room for guesswork as possible so others can move forward without waiting for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate chances for misunderstanding.</li>
<li>Always include the exact link, ticket number, or code snippet you’re referring to.</li>
<li>Repeat context where necessary—never assume prior knowledge.</li>
<li>Anticipate potential misinterpretations and resolve them up front.</li>
<li>Add screenshots or short recordings to show what you’re seeing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-use-the-right-medium">2. Use the Right Medium</h3>
<p>Match the message to the channel. Choosing the right medium keeps discussions organized and easier to revisit later.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email</strong>: Best for long explanations or walking through complex troubleshooting steps.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Docs</strong>: Perfect when a topic will evolve, requires comments, or involves multiple parts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing the right medium keeps discussions organized and easier to revisit later.</p>
<h3 id="3-set-timeframes-explicitly">3. Set Timeframes Explicitly</h3>
<p>Async communication doesn’t mean instant responses. But when a timeline matters, say so.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Please reply by Friday EOD.”</em></li>
<li>This sets expectations and prevents silent delays.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-keep-discussions-transparent">4. Keep Discussions Transparent</h3>
<p>Future teammates—or even current ones—may need to reference your discussion later.  This avoids repeating explanations and reduces onboarding friction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Document conversations in accessible places eg. open Slack channels or an email with a team alias in cc.</li>
<li>Link relevant threads or docs so new collaborators can get up to speed quickly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-always-include-a-tldr">5. Always Include a TL;DR</h3>
<p>Everyone is drowning in email, chat threads, and documents. A concise <strong>summary at the top</strong> helps your readers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quickly understand what you need.</li>
<li>Decide how much time to invest in the details.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Async communication is not just about efficiency; it’s about enabling collaboration across distance and time zones. By being clear, deliberate, and transparent, you save your teammates time and keep projects moving—no matter where in the world you are.</p>
