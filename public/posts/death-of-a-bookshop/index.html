<p>The signs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy 1 book get 3 free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;70% off on all books&rdquo;</p>
<p>Empty shelves. Unkempt books. The last remains of a once popular bookshop. The couches and beanbags tossed to a side.</p>
<p>Second hand dealers making away with carton loads of books, emptying the shelves as we browse. The death rattle for what was once a bustling refuge for the lettered class of society.</p>
<p>I had never watched a bookshop close in this fashion before. Imagine the state of Foyles in London if that were to close in this way. It seems to me only a matter of time. Amazon will claim many more lives in the coming years.</p>
<p>The scenes I describe are not in London, but India. The bookshop I saw closing is not a cute little independent seller, but a large chain. But the signs are disconcerting nonetheless.</p>
<p>Though I hope the death of the bookshop may take a while, when it does come it may in fact be worse in London than what I saw. In Kochi I saw vultures — not browsing but taking — books in cartons which may then be resold somewhere and have another life. In London when this does happen, I feel there will not even be any interest from the dealers since they would have long vanished themselves. It would be a quiet affair. There will be offers:</p>
<p><strong>All books for free. Everything must go.</strong></p>
