      <title>Hitler : Nemesis (Book Review)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Ian Kershaw&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to better understand Hitler’s character and maybe pick up some interesting new stories, I started reading another tome, Hitler - Nemesis (1936-45) by Ian Kershaw.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/hitler-nemesis.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hitler Nemesis Book Cover&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a very dense book, with long chapters and a lot of citations. Its not light reading and took me a year or so of reading it off and on to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One aspect of the story is Kershaw’s theory that a great majority of the German people were indeed in support for a majority of Hitler’s plans. Like all things in history, this is not something I can agree with wholeheartedly because it is a theory and there are those that don’t think it to be the case. The concept of ‘working towards the führer’ where, though there was no direct command from Hitler for most of the atrocities of the war, the machinery of the government filled out the blanks left by Hitler’s vague comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Death of a Bookshop</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The signs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Buy 1 book get 3 free!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;70% off on all books&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Empty shelves. Unkempt books. The last remains of a once popular bookshop. The couches and beanbags tossed to a side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second hand dealers making away with carton loads of books, emptying the shelves as we browse. The death rattle for what was once a bustling refuge for the lettered class of society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had never watched a bookshop close in this fashion before. Imagine the state of Foyles in London if that were to close in this way. It seems to me only a matter of time. Amazon will claim many more lives in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Great War for Civilization (Book Review)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/great-war-for-civilization/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Robert Fisk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This book is a tome. It weighs in at 1286 pages and another 50 pages of bibliography and notes. It has taken me the best part of 6 months of reading – in bits and pieces – to get through it. Probably because of the way I read it, but also because of the sheer depth and breadth of what is covered in this book, I don’t have a quick summary. I can only tell you my learnings and lasting images. These aren’t pretty images and this is not a book for the faint hearted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reading Magazines While We Still Can</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah the joy of finding a new magazine with great articles. I have found a new love – long form narrative journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It started on my trip to San Francisco from work last December. The apartment I was staying in had a few hundred New Yorker magazines piled up. On weekday nights I could walk around San Fran and experience the city, but I didn’t want to splurge or get mugged, and was quite happy putting my feet up and reading. So I got stuck into those New Yorker magazines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
