**_by Ian Kershaw_**


In an attempt to better understand Hitler’s character and maybe pick up some interesting new stories, I started reading another tome, Hitler - Nemesis (1936-45) by Ian Kershaw.

This is a very dense book, with long chapters and a lot of citations. Its not light reading and took me a year or so of reading it off and on to complete. 

One aspect is Kershaw’s theory that a great majority of the German people were indeed in support for a majority of Hitler’s plans. Like all things in history, this is not something I can agree with wholeheartedly because it is a theory and there are those that don’t think it to be the case. The concept of [‘working towards the führer’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Kershaw#%22Working_Towards_the_Führer%22_concept)where, though there was no direct command from Hitler for most of the atrocities of the war, the machinery of the government filled out the blanks left by Hitler’s vague comments. 

Another was the [Blomberg-Fritsch affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blomberg–Fritsch_affair). Its the story of how Hitler wrestled control of the military establishment. Blomberg, the War Minister, married a convicted prostitute - when prostitution was illegal in Germany at the time. And Frisch (the Commander in Chief) was accused of having a homosexual affair - which was later proved to be drummed up with a false witness. With both of these senior military figures unemployable in the highest military positions, both of whom were against war preparation, Hitler conveniently assumed control. 

History lessons in school, especially Indian schools, don’t cover the nitty gritty and there is limited inquisitiveness encouraged when the priority is placed on scoring a grade in the final exam. There is no time to review the small interesting points of history which were turning points. Like [Neville Chamberlain’s statement](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KWQcos95hHsC&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=neville+chamberlain+%22relied%22&source=bl&ots=BGcbNWj2wS&sig=0lT6zHMIf1WODz_2waNg0XXZ8m8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKo4PN8afMAhUI7hoKHUNSD04Q6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&q=neville%20chamberlain%20%22relied%22&f=false) after meeting with Hitler in Munich 1938 that ‘[he] got the impression that here was a man [Hitler] who could be relied upon when he had given his word’.

I am not a historian and this was my first in depth reading of the Third Reich. With that in mind I felt this gave me a more rounded view into what happened. A more seasoned reviewer  - or at least someone I think is more seasoned because he writes for the Guardian - was [not overly impressed with the book](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/07/historybooks.biography), due particularly to the dependance on Hitler’s own conversations. Somehow, he expects Kershaw to have a lens into Hitler’s mind. I don’t think thats possible.
